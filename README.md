# Simple and rudimentary unit testing framework for the C programming language.

## this is in its very early stages. For now, you can compare unsigned 32 bit integers only.

## To use this module:
- create a .c file to write your tests in. Follow the example_c_test.c file for guidance.
- to compile: $ make
- to run:     $ make run
- to clean:   $ make clean
 
## Sample output for the example_c_test.c file is shown below:
